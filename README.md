## Masters Sweepstake Leaderboard

Every year, I and many friends throw some money into a pot and get randomly drawn two entrants to [The Masters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament), an infamous golf tournament. The person whose allocated golfer wins the tournament gets the lion's share of the money.

Every golfer plays a round on both the Thursday and the Friday and only a top fraction make it through to play 2 more rounds over the weekend. Over the course of the tournament, the positions of the golfers varies dramatically. This project shows a live leaderboard of the tournament, but not just of the golfers - it also shows me and my friends moving up and down the leaderboard too. This is done using [kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/), which turns the leaderboard from [BBC Sport's Golf Website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/) into a structured API, and a very simple front end.
